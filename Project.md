## Intro

Music consumption through the years has highly evolved and democratized
itself. Before 1877, if someone wanted to listen to music, they either
had to know how to play it, or had to pay to go to a concert, an operaâ€¦
but this all changed with the invention of the phonograph, first way to
have a orchestra at home. It was fairly expensive and thus only the
wealthiest could access it (only a small possible audience). Through the
years, the way to

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
